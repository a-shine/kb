<h1>Graph knowledge base</h1>
<p>This repository contains the knowledge base and tooling for the graph knowledge base.</p>
<p>Problem statement
As Jekyll and other static site generators do not have native capabilities to handle wikilike content, we need to find a way to handle this. This repository contains not only the knowledge but the custom node.js script to convert the markdown files into HTML files to be used by Jekyll.</p>
<p>Before being provided to Jekyll we need to process the wikilinks and convert them into HTML links. This is done by the <code>wikilinks.js</code> script.</p>
