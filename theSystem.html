title: The system</h2>
<p>Each note is an atomic concept.</p>
<p>This is an experiment to demonstrate how many concepts are relevant across fields and the traditional taxonomy of fileds such as ohysics, engineerinf, maths and computer science are limiting.</p>
<p>Something I learned from computer science is that there are fundamental universal problesm such as constraint satisdfaction (optimisation) or sorting. The fundamental abstract problems exist in all fields.</p>
<p>Best efforst for the development of my own knowledge but more than happy to accept contributions (just do a Pull Request)</p>
<p>This is not for scrappy or module-specific exam-specific notes - this is about knowledge and understanding how concepts relate</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<ul>
<li>My struglle with note taking (anecdote from university) - so much redundancy concepts re-introduced in different modules - time better spent refining my pre-existing knowledge of the concept, broadning the scope of the concept to include the new perspective provided by the module</li>
<li>desire to Promote cross polination between fields - I am a Computer scientist (CS), so I have a CS perspective but I welcome perspective from other fields --&gt; I have had a few fantatic inderdisciplinary experiences at university -&gt; the times I learned the most were when I was working with people from other fields - it would be interesting to develop a knowlfdge system that doesn't have an underlying taxonomy, each concept lies on a level playing field (no folder, everything is at the root and navigation happens via search and bi-directional links)</li>
<li>outcome of this experiment is to test the reach of fundamental problems and concepts across fields - see if there are underlying patterns that emmerge</li>
</ul>
