title: The system
---

Each note is an atomic concept. [the system](./theSystem.md)

This is an experiment to demonstrate how many concepts are relevant across fields and the traditional taxonomy of fileds such as ohysics, engineerinf, maths and computer science are limiting. 

Something I learned from computer science is that there are fundamental universal problesm such as constraint satisdfaction (optimisation) or sorting. The fundamental abstract problems exist in all fields.

Best efforst for the development of my own knowledge but more than happy to accept contributions (just do a Pull Request)

This is not for scrappy or module-specific exam-specific notes - this is about knowledge and understanding how concepts relate


Abstract

Introduction
- My struglle with note taking (anecdote from university) - so much redundancy concepts re-introduced in different modules - time better spent refining my pre-existing knowledge of the concept, broadning the scope of the concept to include the new perspective provided by the module
- desire to Promote cross polination between fields - I am a Computer scientist (CS), so I have a CS perspective but I welcome perspective from other fields --> I have had a few fantatic inderdisciplinary experiences at university -> the times I learned the most were when I was working with people from other fields - it would be interesting to develop a knowlfdge system that doesn't have an underlying taxonomy, each concept lies on a level playing field (no folder, everything is at the root and navigation happens via search and bi-directional links)
- outcome of this experiment is to test the reach of fundamental problems and concepts across fields - see if there are underlying patterns that emmerge

Problem statement
- The limitation of tree based file systems on OSs
- The problem with the traditional taxonomy of fields

Approach
- creation of this formalised public kb

Result
- TBD
